# Advent of Code 2018

This repo contains my solutions to the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenge.

I will be attempting most or all of the solutions in [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) (specifically [GHC](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC)).

## Setup

This project uses [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org). Assuming you have Stack installed, the easiest way to evaluate the code examples is to launch the GHCi REPL via `stack ghci` in the root directory.
